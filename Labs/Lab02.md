# **Outcomes:** 
1. Detail Python variables and functions.
2. Learn what is `list` and how to perform some simple calculations on list items.


# **Task:** 
1. Answer all subsections using whichever loop format you prefer.
2. (Optional) `Commit` & `Push` your work to your own github repo.

## Part 1 (30pt)
**Q:** Take the following `list` and multiply all items within it. And print the result.
```python
list1 = [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096]
```

### Part 2 (30pt)
**Q:** Take the following `list` and sum all items within it. And print the result.
```python
list2 = [-1, 23, 483, 8573, -13847, -381569, 1652337, 718522177]
```

### Part 3 (40pt)
**Q:** Take the following `list` and get the summation of items which are even. (Hint: Use `modulo` operation `%` to tell if an item is odd or even.)
```python
list3 = [146, 875, 911, 83, 81, 439, 44, 5, 46, 76, 61, 68, 1, 14, 38, 26, 21]
