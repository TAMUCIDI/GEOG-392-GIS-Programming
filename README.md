## Catalog Description

Programming for geographic information science applications; principles of programming syntax and data structures; development of custom GIS programs; integration of programs into commercial GIS platforms.

## Course Description

This class is an introduction to programming in general and an introduction to programming for Geographic Information Systems (GIS) in particular. This project- and lab-oriented course covers the guiding principles behind programming syntax and data structures, and how to apply these techniques to the development of custom standalone GIS programs and the integration of these into commercial GIS platforms. The course also includes an applied section where the student will identify a real-world “customer” and lead a team of undergraduates to complete a project.

## Learning Outcomes or Course Objectives

This course is designed to introduce students to the basics of programming with modern programming languages in the context of development for and with GIS. Students will learn how to apply this knowledge to develop custom GIS applications and extensions that solve real-world problems. This course will provide students with a solid foundation in fundamental programming techniques and the knowledge to apply these techniques within GIS programming domains.

The course will start with an introduction to fundamental programming structures and techniques and quickly advance to programming issues related to developing for GIS platforms including integration of their code into industry standard GIS platforms to extend the capabilities of these systems.

The course will include a lecture component where theoretical issues are covered, and homework and lab-based exercises where students have the opportunity to practice implementing these techniques in the Python programming language.

This course will also include identification of and interaction with a real-world “customer” who needs GIS programming. Students will learn software project management skills while participating in a team led by a graduate student and have the opportunity to interact with a real-world “customer” to experience the identification and translation of customer requirements into application development.  

At the end of this class, each student will be able to:

1. Identify a set of requirements for the development of a software system;

2. Implement standalone programming projects in Python to solve GIS problems;

3. Integrate custom code into ArcGIS that customizes, automates, and extents its functionality;
4. Programmatically access GIS data and use these data in GIS modeling, computation, visualization, and analysis; and
5. Conceptualize, design, plan, implement, and document a custom GIS programming solution to a real-world problem.
